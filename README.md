# Emeril-Cafe
An ordering system developed using Node JS, MongoDb and Angular JS

Features:

The application has two panels. Panel display is created so that it is simpler and faster for Emeril to take orders as it wont need 
navigations. The application is also portable i.e. it can be used on any device i.e. cell phones, laptops etc.

The upper Menu Panel is for building the menu card. Emeril can add/remove items to the menu as needed.
The lower Order Panel is created to tyake orders from customers. It has a dropdown which has items from the menu card. 
When items are added to the cart, an order summary is displayed on the right which has all items ordered and their corresponding price.

At the bottom we have the total bill generated for the order which includes the 7.5% tax.

Required validations are added so that there are no errors while adding items to menu or cart. Error messages are displayed on top right corner of the display.
